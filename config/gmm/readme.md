## Uncertainty for Identifying Open-Set Errors in Visual Object Detection

Reference implementation: [https://github.com/dimitymiller/openset_detection](https://github.com/dimitymiller/openset_detection)

We have extended the method for RetinaNet and FCOS architectures. 

The `(...)_trainset.py` configs are used to extract known/training logits needed to construct Gaussian Mixture Models.
